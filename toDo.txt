                            A symphony of scents begins to rise,
                            As sausages meet the grill's fiery eyes,
                            The grill, a conductor, holds the baton,
                            Cooking sausages to perfection's dawn.

                            Each sausage sings its own unique song,
                            A medley of flavors, bold and strong.
                            A burst of pleasure with each tender bite,
                            Grilling sausages is pure delight.
                            
                            The grill master, a culinary hero,
                            Flipping and turning with a rhythmic flow,
                            Tending to the sausages with loving care,
                            Ensuring they're cooked with expertise rare.

                            So gather 'round the grill, one and all,
                            Let's savor the sausages, big and small,
                            With flames as our guide, we shall unite,
                            In the joy of grilling, a culinary delight.

-dropping a sausage ontop of another creates a weird texture-- make sure that sausage dropped in water texture is perfectly symmetrical.
